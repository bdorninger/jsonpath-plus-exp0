## TODO

- merge option "index" should not be used for different purpose than to provide the index for an insert op. Also used for sorting!
- Introduce a specific sortProp property for indicating which property in the array elements to use for sorting (or refact the sort: boolean prop to sort: string)
- Allow the providing of a comparator function
