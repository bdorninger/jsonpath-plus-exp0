In that case the snippets might go to different insertionPoints\nGlobal meta info of a model/snippet may be concentrated into a 'meta' data section\nInsertionPoints and insertAt must reside at the correct position in the snippet data and the target model respectively\ninsertAt might also be a JSON path, we can also use another special element as well, e.g. 'insertAtPath'",
